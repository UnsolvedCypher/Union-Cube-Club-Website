          <h1>Judging and Running</h1>
          <p>Judging and running are both fairly straightforward tasks that
          everyone should know how to do. Even though they may not seem like a
          big deal, they can and often do make the difference between being
          behind schedule or finishing on time. If a delegate or organizer asks
          for more judges, please come help even if it's only for a bit,
          because this is what really makes the competition run.</p>
          <h2>Judging</h2>
            <h3>Hint: <a href=Cheat%20Sheet.pdf>Here's a cheat sheet for judging</a></h3>
          <p>Judging is not too difficult - you don't even have to be a cuber
          to do it well. While you don't have to know every single regulation,
          it is easier the more you know. However, since we know you can't
          memorize everything, <a href=Cheat%20Sheet.pdf>we've prepared some cheat sheets with a list of
          penalties so you can refer to it when needed</a> If you're still not
          sure, just ask an experienced judge or the delegate - it's always
          better to be cautions!</p>
          <h3>Getting a Cube</h3>
          <p>To start, sit down at your judging station. You should be sitting
          on one of the short sides of the table. If the competition is using a
          runner system (which it usually is), just raise your hand and someone
          will bring you a cube cover with a cube and scoresheet. Otherwise,
          just walk up to the scrambling table and take one. Then, call out the
          competitor's name as it's written on the scorecard and wait for them
          to come over. If they don't come within a reasonable amount of time,
          get a different cube and let the delegate know.</p>
          <h3>Stopwatches</h3>
          <p>Although the delegate/organizer will provide stopwatches to time
          inspection, they usually aren't as easy to use as you might like. If
          you have a smartphone or tablet, the best option is to direct your
          browser to <a href=
          "http://cubing.net/inspection">cubing.net/inspection</a>. Now, just
          tap to start and tap to stop - it will flash at 8 and 12, which we'll
          talk about later. This timer resets automatically when started, so
          don't worry about that.</p>
          <h3>Starting the Solve</h3>
          <p>Take out the scorecard and put it next to you. Put the cube
          cover on top of the cube (so the cube is fully covered)
          and put the entire thing on the Stackmat. If this is the first round
          of the first event and you don't know the competitor, ask if they've
          competed before and if not, let them practice starting and stopping
          the Stackmat. Before they start the solve, there are a few things you
          should check for - the competitor can't have electronic headphones or
          earbuds, they can't have a personal light, and they can't have any
          kind of screen or mirror facing them. This means that they can take a
          video, as long as they're not able to see the video. They also can't
          be talking to anyone during the solve. Ask the competitor if they are
          ready, and when they say yes, simultaneously lift the cube cover and
          tap your device to start the timer.</p>
          <h3>Ending the Solve</h3>
          <p>Look at the inspection timer. If the time is under 15, they're
          fine. If it's between 15 and 17, they have a 2 second starting
          penalty. If it's over 17, they get a DNF. The other thing to check
          for is to make sure the cube is solved. If all the sides are aligned
          under 45 degrees (or 120 for a Skewb or Pyraminx), it's fine. If one
          of the sides is over 45 degrees, then they get a +2 ending penalty.
          Otherwise, it's a DNF. Check out the judging cheat sheet for a
          complete list of penalties. Now, on the scorecard, write all the
          starting penalties, their time, and then the ending penalties, then
          an equals sign and the total. For example, if they got two +2
          starting penalties and one +2 ending penalty with a time of 23.143,
          you should write "2+2+23.143+2 = 29.143". Now, just sign your name
          and have them sign theirs, rinse, and repeat!</p>
          <h2>Running</h2>
          <p>Running is just as important as judging, and after there's a
          certain number of people competing, it's significantly more efficient
          than having each judge get their own cube. The process is very simple
          - just go up to the scrambling table, take a cube cover with
          a cube in it, and give it to a judge who is raising their hand. Take
          any solved cubes in cube covers and bring those up to the
          scrambling table. Be sure to take out the scorecard, put it face-up,
          and put the cube on top of it and the cover off to the side.
          This makes it much easier for scramblers. That's it! That's really
          all there is! If you want to help out in a competiton, this is the
          easiest thing you can possibly do!</p>
