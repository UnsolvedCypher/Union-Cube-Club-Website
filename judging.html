          <h1>Judging and Running</h1>
          <p>Judging and running skills everyone should have because helping
              out helps keep competitions on schedule. This page should help
            you learn the basics.</p>
          <h2>Judging</h2>
            <p>Hint: <a href=Cheat%20Sheet.pdf>Here's a cheat sheet for judging</a></p>
          <p>Judging is not too difficult - you don't even have to be a cuber
          to do it well. While you don't have to know every single regulation,
          it is easier the more you know. However, since we know you can't
          memorize everything, <a href=Cheat%20Sheet.pdf>we've prepared some cheat sheets with a list of
          penalties so you can refer to it when needed</a>. If you're still not
          sure, just ask an experienced judge or the delegate - it's always
          better to be cautious!</p>
          <h3>Getting a Cube</h3>
          <p>To start, sit down at your judging station. You should be sitting
          on one of the short sides of the table. If the competition is using a
          runner system (which it usually is), just raise your hand and someone
          will bring you a cube cover with a cube and scoresheet. Otherwise,
          just walk up to the scrambling table and take one. Then, call out the
          competitor's name as it's written on the scorecard and wait for them
          to come over. If they don't come within a reasonable amount of time,
          get a different cube and let the delegate know.</p>
          <h3>Stopwatches</h3>
          <p>Although the delegate/organizer will provide stopwatches to time
          inspection, they usually aren't as easy to use as you might like. If
          you have a smartphone or tablet, the best option is to direct your
          browser to <a href=
          "http://cubing.net/inspection">cubing.net/inspection</a>. Now, just
          tap to start and tap to stop - it will flash at 8 and 12, which we'll
          talk about later. This timer resets automatically when started, so
          don't worry about that.</p>
          <h3>Starting the Solve</h3>
          <p>Take out the scorecard and put it next to you. Put the cube
          cover on top of the cube (so the cube is fully covered)
          and put the entire setup on the Stackmat. If this is the first round
          of the first event and you don't know the competitor, ask if they've
          competed before and if not, let them practice starting and stopping
          the Stackmat. Before they start the solve, there are a few things you
          should check for - the competitor can't have electronic headphones or
          earbuds, they can't have a personal light, and they can't have any
          kind of screen or mirror facing them. This means that they can take a
          video, as long as they're not able to see the video. They also can't
          be talking to anyone during the solve. Ask the competitor if they are
          ready, and when they say yes, simultaneously lift the cube cover and
          tap your device to start the timer.</p>
          <h3>Ending the Solve</h3>
          <p>If the competitor started after more than 15 seconds of inspection,
            they get a penalty: a +2 if it's under 17 seconds or a DNF otherwise.
            Next, make sure the cube is solved. If one side is over 45 degrees off,
            there is a +2 penalty. If more than one side is more than 45 degrees off,
            it's a DNF. On the competitor's scorecard, write down the time, any penalties,
            and the total time including penalties. If it's a DNF, write DNF.
          </p>
          <h2>Running</h2>
          <p>Running is also very important, and is easy to do. If you want to help
            out but aren't comfortable judging (or there are no open stations), this
            is a great option.
          Just go up to the scrambling table, take a cube cover with
          a cube in it, and give it to a judge who is raising their hand. Take
          any solved cubes in cube covers and bring those up to the
          scrambling table. At the scrambling table, put the scorecard face-up,
          place the cube on top, and put the cube cover to the side, and get
          more cubes to bring to judges.</p>
