          <h1>Competing</h1>
          <p>Competing for the first time may seem intimidating, but it isn't
          nearly as scary as it may seem. This guide should help you learn how
          a competition works so that you can be prepared when attending
          one.</p>
          <h2>Should I compete?</h2>
          <p>In pretty much every case, the answer is yes. Use <a href=
          "https://cubingusa.com">CubingUSA</a> to find a competition near you.
          If there isn't one, look at our yearly overview page. If you're
          concerned about speed, you really shouldn't be. While some events may
          have cutoffs, 3x3 usually does not, and it's a great event to get
          started. Even though it's called a "competition," people of all
          abilities are welcome, and very few people actually come with the
          expectation of winning.</p>
          <h2>Before the Competition</h2>
          <p>Even before the actual competing part, there are some tasks that
          need to be taken care of. First, make sure you pre-register for the
          competition online. Some competitions allow you to register at the
          door, but it's much easier for the organizers (and for you) if you
          register online. When you register, it's highly recommended that you
          make a CubingUSA account. With a CubingUSA account, you don't have to
          re-enter all of your information for every competition you register
          for, and you can also change your registration after submitting it.
          Leading up to the competition, be sure to thoroughly read the
          website. The website generally doesn't have too much text, but it has
          important information about how to get there, parking, food, cutoffs,
          and anything else you may need to know. Also, be sure to check your
          email for anything important the organizer may need to tell you. If
          you need to be accomodated in any way, have any questions, or have a
          condition that the organizer should know about, email them using the
          contact page.</p>
          <p>A brief note about the regulations: you don't have to read the
          entire document, but please be familiar with the basic rules at
          competitions. That being said, always ask a judge or a delegate if
          you're not sure about something!</p>
          <h2>The Day Of</h2>
          <p>Make sure you get to the competition on time. If you arrive after
          registration, it is very inconvenient for the organizers and you may
          not even be allowed to compete. You will generally need to check-in
          at the registration table, giving them your name and paying if you
          haven't already. Then, you can proceed to the seating area until the
          competition starts. When the competition starts, someone will
          announce the start of the first event and call up names. Listen
          carefully - you may miss your turn if you don't hear your name.
          Unless you are told that this is the case, don't assume that all the
          names are being called up at once; names are usually called in
          smaller groups depending on the number of tables available. Once your
          name is called, place your cube onto the card with your name on it at
          the designated table, and wait in the competitor area. While in this
          area, it's fine to talk, but make sure you're not in the way of
          runners (meaning you should be off to the side) and never discuss the
          scrambles in any way.</p>
          <h2>The Solve</h2>
          <p>When your name is called again, go up to the table with the person
          that called your name, and sit down. It is a good idea to tell that
          person (this is your judge) whether this is your first time so that they
          can help you with anything you aren't familiar with. If you haven't
          used a Stackmat timer before, ask to practice starting and stopping
          one so that it isn't an issue during your solve. After you sit down,
          the judge will ask whether you are ready, and say "yes" when you are.
          The judge will lift the cube cover, you will inspect, and then you
          must put down your cube and start the solve within 15 seconds. At 8
          seconds, the judge will say "8" and at 12, "12." When you stop the
          timer, don't touch the cube or the timer until the judge has written
          down your time and you have both signed the scorecard. Now, go back
          to the competitor area. For most events, you have 5 attempts, and
          after your fifth, you should take your cube with you, leaving only
          the scorecard.</p>
          <h2>While not Competing</h2>
          <p>Enjoy yourself! You are in a room full of cubers, and the vast
          majority are friendly, so go up and talk to someone! Competitions are
          a great place to make friends. If the organizers need people to help
          out, that's a great thing to do as well, as it helps the competition
          and is a fun way to meet people. Have fun!</p>
