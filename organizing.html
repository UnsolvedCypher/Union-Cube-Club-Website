                <h1>Organizing</h1>
                <h2>Are you qualified?</h2>
                <p>Organizing certainly has its benefits, but it's also a very big responsibility. While it's great to have lots of organizers and competitions in the Union area, the organizers need to be qualified in order for competitions to run smoothly. Before you think about organizing, you should have attended several competitions and been very helpful lately, to the point where the delegate knows you. You also need to have access to a suitable venue and be willing to put the time and money into making sure everything goes well. If you think you have what it takes, talk to your delegate when you next see them, or find their contact information using the button below: </p>
                <a class = "btn btn-primary" href="htts://www.worldcubeassociation.org/delegates">Contact a Delegate</a>
                <p><br>If you've started the organizing process, you may find this checklist useful. It certainly isn't completely inclusive, but you should make sure you've done everything that applies to your situation.</p>
                
<ol>
	<li/>
Find a date
	<ol> <li/>
Ask your delegate for available dates <li/>
Ask your venue for available dates <li/>
Find dates that overlap and preferably don't overlap with SAT dates or school vacation <li/>
Make sure you're not too close to another nearby competition <li/>
Confirm your date with delegates and any other organizers
	</ol>
	<li/>
Book a venue
	<ol> <li/>
Make sure there's room for the number of people you expect <li/>
Make sure WiFi is available <li/>
Find out whether there is a PA system (Massachusetts organizers, email Lexington Cubing) <li/>
If you're planning on having food and drinks, ask about refrigeration if needed
	</ol>
	<li/>
Create a
	schedule
	<ol> <li/>
Go to this page and go to File &gt; Make a Copy. This spreadsheet should help you estimate a schedule, but rely on experience and commonsense – this spreadsheet can be inaccurate. <li/>
Fill in all necessary blue fields, and fill in the green fields with your final times <li/>
Put the events in a logical order. More popular events should generally be before lunch so that people can leave when they are done. <li/>
Confirm the schedule with your delegate
	</ol>
	<li/>
Create a
	website
	<ol> <li/>
Ask your delegate to create a CubingUSA page and add you and any other organizers as administrators <li/>
Enter all information your competitors may need, including information about lunch and cutoffs <li/>
On the travel page, you need to set the map to go to your venue's address. To do this, right click on the iFrame (in edit mode) and use this page to find the URL (<a href="https://support.google.com/maps/answer/3544418?hl=en">https://support.google.com/maps/answer/3544418?hl=en</a>) <li/>
When your website is done, ask your delegate to take a look at it, approve it, and make it public <li/>
Make a post on Speedsolving, Cyoubx's Friends (Facebook), and /r/cubers (reddit)
	</ol>
	<li/>
Design/Graphics
	<ol> <li/>
Union Cube Club provides a graphics toolkit for Union competitions to use. This includes files that can be modified with GIMP as well as ODT files. You don't have to use them, but we encourage you to take a look.
	</ol>
	<li/>
CubeComps
	<ol> <li/>
Email CubeComps well in advance of your competition, or contact them on Facebook if you don't know their email. You must wait at least a week after your competition has been officially announced. <li/>
Set up CubeComps by adding all events, adding cutoffs, and sending them your logo and schedule (as specified in the link they will send you)
	</ol>
	<li/>
Volunteer
	Judges
	<ol> <li/>
If you have non-cuber volunteer judges, this video may come in handy. Also, be sure to print out the judging cheat sheet
