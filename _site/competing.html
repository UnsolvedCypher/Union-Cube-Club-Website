<p>Competing for the first time may seem intimidating, but it isn’t nearly as scary as it may seem. This guide should help you learn how a competition works so that you can be prepared when attending one.</p>

<h2 id="should-i-compete">Should I compete?</h2>
<p><strong>Yes.</strong> Use <a href="https://cubingusa.com">CubingUSA</a> to find a competition near you. Competitions are about having a good time and beating yor own records - there’s no reason not to compete!</p>

<h2 id="before-the-competition">Before the Competition</h2>

<p><strong>Make sure you pre-register</strong> for the competition online. This may or may not be required, but it’s easier for you and the organizer. When you register, it’s highly recommended that you make a CubingUSA account. With a CubingUSA account, you don’t have to re-enter all of your information for every competition you register for, and you can also change your registration after submitting it.</p>

<p>Be sure to <strong>read the competition website.</strong> It will have important information about food, cutoffs, and anything else. If you need more information, use the contact page.</p>

<p><em>Be familiar with the regulations.</em> You don’t have to know them by heart, but you should know the basic rules. This page should cover most of them, but if you have a question, ask the delegate.</p>

<h2 id="the-day-of">The Day Of</h2>

<p><strong>Get to the competition on time.</strong> If you arrive after registration, you might not be allowed to compete. You will generally need to check-in at the registration table, then proceed to the seating area until the competition starts.</p>

<p>When the competition starts, someone will announce the start of the first event and call up names. <strong>Listen
carefully</strong> - you may miss your turn if you don’t hear your name. Names are often called up in small groups, so you might not be called until later. Once your name is called, <strong>place your cube onto your scorecard</strong> (the card with your name on it) at the designated table, and wait in the competitor area. While in this area, it’s fine to talk, but make sure you’re not in the way of runners (meaning you should be off to the side) and <em>never discuss the scrambles in any way.</em></p>

<h2 id="the-solve">The Solve</h2>

<p>When your name is called again, <strong>go to your judge</strong> (whoever called your name) and sit down at the table. If it’s your first time competing, ask to practice starting and stopping the timer, and ask questions if you have them. When the judge asks, let them know you are ready, and he or she will lift the cube cover. You must inspect the cube and <strong>start the timer</strong> within 15 seconds. The judge will let you know at 8 and 12 seconds. When you stop the timer, <strong>don’t touch the cube</strong> or the timer until the judge has written down your time and you both <strong>sign the scorecard.</strong> Now, go back to the competitor area if you have solves remaining, otherwise don’t forget to take your cube back!</p>

<h2 id="while-not-competing">While Not Competing</h2>

<p>Enjoy yourself! You are in a room full of cubers, and the vast majority are friendly, so go up and talk to someone! Competitions are a great place to make friends. If the organizers need people to help out, that’s a great thing to do as well, as it helps the competition and is a fun way to meet people. Have fun!</p>
