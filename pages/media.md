Photos and Videos
=================

The Union Cube Club has a Flickr group to help collect photos and videos from all of its competitions. If you have photos or videos you don't mind sharing, please join our group using the button below! The only requirement is that you tag every photo or video with the full competition name (including the year), without spaces (tags for the most recent competitions will be on the main page).
