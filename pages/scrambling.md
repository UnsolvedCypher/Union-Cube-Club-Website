Scrambling
==========

Scrambling is pretty straightforward, but there are a few things you should know. This guide won't cover notation (you should look up any notation you aren't familiar with, such as clock or Skewb), but it will cover some important information for scrambling.

Scrambling Orientation
----------------------

For all cubic puzzles, the top face should be the lightest color, and the front (or right-front on Skewb) should be the darkest possible color. For a normal color scheme, that means white on top and green in front. For Pyraminx, the darkest color should be in front and the lightest on the bottom. For a normal color scheme, that means green in front and yellow on the bottom. For clock, the orientation doesn't matter. For Square-1, the darkest possible scrambling side should be in front. 

The Scrambling
--------------

First, take a cube cover facing sideways, indicating that the cube needs to be scrambled. Find the scramble on the sheet for the solve the competitor is about to do, orient the cube properly, and execute the scramble. After checking the scramble using the diagram on the sheet, put both the scorecard and the cube into a cube cover box, and place it upright near the edge of the table. If a scorecard has a note indicating an extra scramble, execute the extra scramble rather than the normal one. If the scorecard has a note or marking you don't understand, consult the delegate or another scrambler.

You should not scramble for an event in which you haven't competed unless you've discussed the situation with the delegate. If you are scrambling, thanks a lot! It's a huge help for the competition.
