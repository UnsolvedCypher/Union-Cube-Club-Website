Organizing
==========

Are you qualified?
------------------
Organizing is a lot of fun and we're always looking to have more competitions. However, organizers need to be competent to increase the chances of competitions going smoothly.  Before you think about organizing, you should have attended several competitions and been very helpful lately, to the point where the delegate knows you. You also need to have access to a suitable venue and be willing to put the time and money into making sure everything goes well. If you think you have what it takes, talk to your delegate when you next see them, or find their contact information using the button below:

If you've started the organizing process, you may find this checklist
useful. It certainly isn't completely inclusive, but you should make
sure you've done everything that applies to your situation.

<ol class="organizing well">
<li>Find a date
  <ul>
    <li>Ask your delegate for available dates</li>
    <li>Ask your venue for available dates</li>
    <li>Find dates that overlap and preferably don't overlap with SAT dates or school vacation</li>
    <li>Make sure you're not too close to another nearby competition</li>
    <li>Confirm your date with delegates and any other organizers</li>
  </ul>
</li>
<li>Book a venue
  <ul>
    <li>Make sure there's room for the number of people you expect
    (ask your delegate and look at nearby competitions to figure
    out high high demand is)</li>
    <li>Make sure WiFi is available</li>
    <li>Find out whether there is a PA system (Massachusetts
    organizers, <a href="mailto:lexingtoncubing@matthewmcmillan.me">email Lexington Cubing</a> if you need one)</li>
    <li>If you're planning on having food and drinks, ask about
    refrigeration if needed</li>
  </ul>
</li>
<li>Create a schedule
  <ul>
    <li>Go to <a href=
    "https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1DIjU4_VPzuFnWJRRNTn4VE0XnwexneCb4Y0u7AzNOWM/edit#gid=0">
      this page</a> and go to File &gt; Make a copy. This
      spreadsheet should help you estimate a schedule, but rely on
      experience and commonsense â€“ this spreadsheet can be
      inaccurate.
    </li>
    <li>Fill in all necessary blue fields and fill in the green
    fields with your final times</li>
    <li>Put the events in a logical order. More popular events
    should generally be before lunch so that people can leave when
    they are done.</li>
    <li>Confirm the schedule with your delegate</li>
  </ul>
</li>
<li>Create a website
  <ul>
    <li>Ask your delegate to create a CubingUSA page and add you
    and any other organizers as administrators</li>
    <li>Enter all information your competitors may need, including
    information about lunch and cutoffs</li>
    <li>Be sure to set a competitor limit - you don't want your
    venue overflowing from too many people!</li>
    <li>On the travel page, you need to set the map to go to your
    venue's address. To do this, right click on the iFrame (in edit
    mode) and use <a href=
    "https://support.google.com/maps/answer/3544418?hl=en">this
    page</a> to find the URL.
    </li>
    <li>When your website is done, ask your delegate to take a look
    at it, approve it, and make it public</li>
    <li>Make a post on Speedsolving, Cyoubx's Friends (Facebook),
    and /r/cubers (reddit)</li>
  </ul>
</li>
<li>Design/Graphics
  <ul>
    <li>
      <a href="http://tiny.cc/graphics-toolkit">Union Cube Club
      provides a graphics toolkit for Union competitions to
      use</a>. This includes files that can be modified with GIMP
      as well as ODT files. You don't have to use them, but we
      encourage you to take a look.
    </li>
  </ul>
</li>
<li>CubeComps
  <ul>
    <li>A week before your competition, CubeComps will set up a
      website and email you. If you'd like that done earlier, you can contact
      CubeComps through Facebook.</li>
    <li>Set up CubeComps by adding all events, adding cutoffs, and
    sending them your logo and schedule (as specified in the link
    they will send you)</li>
  </ul>
</li>
<li>Volunteer Judges
  <ul>
    <li>If you have non-cuber volunteer judges, <a href=
    "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iMGibfXyEk">this video</a>
    may come in handy. Also, be sure to print out the <a href=
    "Cheat%20Sheet.pdf">judging cheat sheet</a> sheet
    </li>
  </ul>
