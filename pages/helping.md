Judging and Running
===================

Judging and running skills everyone should have because helping out helps keep competitions on schedule. This page should help you learn the basics. If you're not sure how to get started helping out, just ask someone in change; they'll be glad to have another volunteer!

If you haven't competed in the current event yet, make sure to let a staff member or delegate know so that you aren't judging or running with the same scrambles you will be solving.

Judging
-------

Hint: [Here's a cheat sheet for judging](./Cheat%20Sheet.pdf)

Judging is not very difficult - you don't even have to be a cuber to do it well. While you don't have to know every single regulation, it is easier the more you know. However, since we know you can't memorize everything, [we've prepared some cheat sheets with a list of penalties so you can refer to it when needed](./Cheat%20Sheet.pdf). If you're still not sure, just ask an experienced judge or the delegate - it's always better to make sure!

### Getting a Cube

To start, sit down at your judging station. If the competition is using a runner system (which it usually is), just raise your hand and someone will bring you a cube cover with a cube and scoresheet. Otherwise, just walk up to the scrambling table and take one. Then, call out the competitor's name as it's written on the scorecard and wait for them to come over. If they don't come within a reasonable amount of time, let the delegate know.

Although the delegate will provide stopwatches, you may want to check out [cubing.net/inspection](http://cubing.net/inspection) on your smartphone or tablet. Just tap to start and tap to stop - it will flash at 8 and 12, which we'll talk about later. This timer resets automatically when started, so there is no need to reset.

### Starting the Solve

Take out the scorecard and put it next to you. Put the cube cover on top of the cube (so the cube is fully covered) and put the entire setup on the Stackmat. If this is the first round of the first event and you don't know the competitor, ask if they've competed before and if not, let them practice starting and stopping the Stackmat. Ensure the competitor does not have electronic headphones or earbuds, a personal light, or any kind of screen or mirror facing them. They may take a video as long as they cannot see the screen. They also can't be talking to anyone during the solve. Ask the competitor if they are ready, and when they say yes, simultaneously lift the cube cover and tap your device to start the timer (or start the stopwatch). The competitor must start the timer within 15 seconds of inspection. If they start after 15, they get a +2 penalty, and after 17 is a DNF.

### Ending the Solve

Next, make sure the cube is solved. If one side is over 45 degrees off, there is a +2 penalty. If more than one side is more than 45 degrees off, it's a DNF. On the competitor's scorecard, write down the time. If there are any penalties, write a + after the time and put the sum of the penalties, then put an = and write the final result. For example, if the competitor received 13.293 and 3 +2 penalties, you should write "13.293 + 6 = 19.293". If they receive a DNF, write DNF. You must initial the judge area on the scorecard and ensure that the competitor initials the competitor part.

Running
-------

Running is also very important, and is easy to do. Simply go up to the scrambling table, take a cube cover with a scrambled cube in it, and give it to a judge who is raising their hand or has no cube. Take any solved cubes in cube covers and bring those up to the scrambling table, placing them on their side to indicate they need to be scrambled.
